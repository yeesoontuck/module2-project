    "### **Report on Data Processing Approach**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction**  \n",
    "This report outlines the approach taken for data processing, exploration, and validation in our project. Given the nature of our work, we have chosen to handle these tasks separately from the main pipeline orchestration and data analysis process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Purpose of This Notebook**  \n",
    "The primary function of this notebook is to facilitate data exploration, cleaning, and validation. These steps are crucial in ensuring data quality before it is integrated into further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Separation from Pipeline Orchestration**  \n",
    "As this notebook focuses on pre-processing activities, it is not part of our main pipeline orchestration or analytical workflows. Instead, it serves as a dedicated space to refine and understand the data before it is incorporated into structured analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extending Data Exploration**  \n",
    "In addition to its core purpose, this notebook allows us to extend our data exploration beyond the established star schema tracks. By working within this environment, we can uncover additional insights and refine our approach to data modeling and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**  \n",
    "By keeping data processing separate, we ensure that our pipeline remains streamlined while still leveraging a structured approach to data exploration and validation. This method allows for a more flexible and comprehensive understanding of our dataset without interfering with the core analytical processes.\n"

    "### **Test Case:** \n",
    "##### **Validation of Delivered Order Value Against Payment Receipts**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**  \n",
    "This test case examines the relationship between orders, order items, and payments to ensure data consistency. Specifically, we validate whether delivered orders align with recorded payment receipts while identifying discrepancies in order item tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Observations**  \n",
    "1) Order-Payment Relationship\n",
    "    - Orders are linked to payments.\n",
    "    - Orders are also linked to order items.\n",
    "    - However, order items are not directly linked to payments.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Data Inconsistencies Identified\n",
    "    - Payments exist without corresponding order item details.\n",
    "    - Orders marked as delivered and paid have no order item records.\n",
    "    - A total of 643 transactions are categorized as unavailable, with missing payment values. This highlights inconsistencies in data management, leading to potential misreporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Validation Rule Implementation**  \n",
    "To improve data quality, our validation rules are set as follows:\n",
    "- Accepted: Orders that are cancelled (considered valid exceptions).\n",
    "- Flagged as Errors: Orders with statuses created, delivered, invoiced, shipped, or unavailable that do not have proper order item details. These will require rectification and data cleaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusion**  \n",
    "This validation process highlights critical gaps in data tracking, particularly with missing order item records. By enforcing these validation rules, we ensure greater accuracy in order and payment reconciliation, reducing potential errors in financial reporting and business operations.\n",
